Write a program that encourages the user to enter two fractions, and then displays their
sum in fractional form. (You donâ€™t need to reduce it to lowest terms.) The interaction with
the user might look like this:
Enter first fraction: 1/2
Enter second fraction: 2/5
Sum = 9/10
You can take advantage of the fact that the extraction operator (>>) can be chained to read
in more than one quantity at once: cin >> a >> dummychar >> b;
