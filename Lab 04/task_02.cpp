/*
Create a class called time that has separate int member data for minutes, minutes, and seconds.
One constructor should initialize this data to 0, and another should initialize it to fixed
values. Another member function should display it, in 11:59:59 format. The final member
function should add two objects of type time passed as arguments. A main() program
should create two initialized time objects (should they be const?) and one that isnâ€™t
initialized. Then it should add the two initialized values together, leaving the result in the
third time variable. Finally it should display the value of this third variable. Make
appropriate member functions const.
